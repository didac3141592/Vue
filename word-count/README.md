# More on VUE

Implement this exercise using Vue3.
[Demo](https://omiras.github.io/word-count-tool/)

## Requirements

1. When the user write in the input field, the total word length is displayed in the __fake__ button component
2. The color of the input text should change depending on the world length (odd word length or even word length). The colors choice is up to you.

## Methodology

1. Install Vue3 and check somehow that it works
2. Think about the properties and all the directives that you will need to use before writting any code.
   1. As a bonus, use a [computed property](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/computed.html#computed-properties-and-watchers) to implement the input styleing
3. Implement one requirmenet at a time
